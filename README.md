## Amber Gintare Aleknaite

I am currently enrolled in Makers Academy to become a full-stack developer. After a successful 7-year tenure as an Operations Manager at Tesla, I decided it was time for a career change. In July, I left my previous position and shortly after, began learning to code.
I possess a can-do attitude and firmly believe that if there is a problem, there is always a solution and if there is no solution, there is no point in worrying. I am results-driven, highly determined and hold myself accountable for achieving success with a strong emphasis on attention to detail and team motivation.
I seek a challenging role in a large corporation where I can expand my programming skills by networking with others and contribute to the success of the company by utilizing my previous experience to support my peers and stakeholders.
Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by puzzles. I find coding to be similar in that it involves creating and connecting pieces to build something. The way programs communicate with one another and the endless possibilities of what can be built with a computer truly captivates me. I am thrilled to have found my passion in this field.
