## Amber Gintare Aleknaite

Software developer graduate at Makers Academy looking for a junior role. After 7 successful years as a Vehicle Operations Manager at Tesla, I decided it was time for a career change. I was always fascinated about programming as I think the possibilities to create, progress, build and  learn in this area are endless.  I possess a can-do attitude and firmly believe that if there is a problem, there is always a solution. I am results-driven, highly determined and hold myself accountable for achieving success with a strong emphasis on attention to detail and team motivation. I am seeking a challenging role in a large corp to expand my skills, network, and support peers and stakeholders.
